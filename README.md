##Description
This project is a simulation of a factory where candy is both produced and consumed from the conveyer belt. The simulation must meet the following specifications:  
  - There are precisely 2 producers, and 2 consumers
  - **The producers:** crunchy frog bites and everlasting escargot suckers. These are the two types of candies produced in this factory (Each candy has its own producer thread)
  - **The consumers:** Lucy and Ethel. They are workers in the factory, and consume candies by removing them from the belt and into the box for packaging (Each worker has its own consumer thread)
  - Each individual producer/consumer has their own 'delay' which is the time needed (milliseconds) to either produce or consume a candy. (See 'Optional Arguments' below)
  - No more than 10 candies are on the conveyer belt at any given time.
  - No more than 3 frog bites can be on the conveyer belt at any given time.
  - Candies are taken off the line in the order that they are produced.

##Optional Arguments
**These arguments specify the delays for each individual producer/consumer. If an argument is omitted, it will have a delay of zero.**  

Argument Flags| Description
--------------| -------------
-E N | Specifies the number of milliseconds N that the Ethel consumer requires to put a candy in the box and should be invoked each time Ethel removes a candy regardless of the candy type.
-L N | Similar argument for the Lucy consumer.
-f N | Specifies the number of milliseconds N between the production of each crunchy frog bite.
-e N | Specifies the number of milliseconds N between the production of each everlasting escargot sucker.

##Lessons Learned
- The most influential lesson that I learned from this assignment is how to use semaphores to synchronize multiple threads that are performing actions with the same objects.
- I also learned how to properly implement critical sections (mutex) to avoid corruption when you have multiple threads accessing the same part of memory.
- This project has also sharpened my Object-Oriented Programming skills immensely, since it required multiple classes, objects, as well as communication between the classes.
